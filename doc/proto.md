# Client Protocol

## Overview

Doozer is a highly-available, consistent lock service.
It also lets you store small amounts of metadata as
files in a directory tree. See [data model][data] for a complete
description.

The doozer protocol is used for messages between clients
and servers. A client connects to doozerd by TCP and
transmits *request* messages to a server, which
subsequently returns *response* messages to the client.

(Note: this protocol is partially based on [9P][],
the Plan 9 file protocol. Parts of this document
are paraphrased from the 9P man pages.)

Each message consists of a sequence of bytes comprising
two parts. First, a four-byte header field holds an
unsigned integer, *n*, in big-endian order (most
significant byte first). This is followed by *n* bytes
of data; these *n* bytes represent structured data
encoded in [Protocol Buffer][protobuf] format.

Two Protocol Buffer structures, `Request` and
`Response`, are used for *requests* and *responses*,
respectively. See `src/pkg/server/msg.proto` for their
definitions.

Each request contains at least a tag, described below,
and a verb, to identify what action is desired.
The other fields may or may not be required; their
meanings depend on the verb, as described below.

The tag is chosen and used by the client to identify
the message. The reply to the message
will have the same tag. Clients must arrange that no
two outstanding requests on the same connection have
the same tag.

Each response contains at least a tag.
Other response fields may or may not be present,
depending on the verb of the request.

A client can send multiple requests without waiting for
the corresponding responses, but all outstanding
requests must specify different tags. The server may
delay the response to a request and respond to later
ones; this is sometimes necessary, for example when the
client has issued a `WAIT` request and the response
is sent after a file is modified in the future.

### Data Model

For a thorough description of Doozer's data model,
see [Data Model][data]. Briefly, doozer's store holds
a tree structure of files identified by paths similar
to paths in Unix, and performs only whole-file reads
and writes, which are atomic. The store also records
the *revision* of each write.
This number can be given to a subsequent write
operation to ensure that no
intervening writes have happened.

## Glob Notation

Some of the requests take a glob pattern that can match
zero or more concrete path names.

 - `?` matches a single char in a single path component
 - `*` matches zero or more chars in a single path component
 - `**` matches zero or more chars in zero or more components
 - any other sequence matches itself

## Verbs

Each verb shows the set of request fields it uses,
followed by the set of response fields it provides.

 * `DEL` *path*, *rev* &rArr; &empty;

    Del deletes the file at *path* if *rev* is greater than
    or equal to the file's revision.

 * `GET` *path*, *rev* &rArr; *value*, *rev*

    Gets the contents (*value*) and revision (*rev*)
    of the file at *path* in the specified revision (*rev*).
    If *rev* is not provided, get uses the current revision.

 * `GETDIR` *path*, *rev*, *offset* &rArr; *path*

    Returns the *n*th entry in *path* (a directory) in
    the specified revision (*rev*), where *n* is
    *offset*. It is an error if *path* is not a
    directory.

 * `NOP` (deprecated)

 * `REV` &empty; &rArr; *rev*

    Returns the current revision.

 * `SET` *path*, *rev*, *value* &rArr; *rev*

    Sets the contents of the file at *path* to *value*,
    as long as *rev* is greater than or equal to the file's
    revision.
    Returns the file's new revision.

 * `WAIT` *path*, *rev* &rArr; *path*, *rev*, *value*, *flags*

    Responds with the first change made to any file
    matching *path*, a glob pattern, on or after *rev*.
    The response *path* is the file that was changed;
    the response *rev* is the revision of the change.
    *Value* is the new contents of the file.

    *Flags* is a bitwise combination of values with the
    following meanings (values 1 and 2 are not used):

     * *set* = 4

        The file was changed or created.

     * *del* = 8

        The file was deleted.

 * `WALK` *path*, *rev*, *offset* &rArr; *path*, *rev*, *value*

    Returns the *n*th file with a name matching *path*
    (a glob pattern) in the specified revision (*rev*),
    where *n* is *offset*.

## Errors

The server might send a response with the `err_code` field
set. In that case, `err_detail` might also be set, and
the other optional response fields will be unset.

If `err_detail` is set, it provides extra information as
defined below.

Error codes are defined with the following meanings:

 * `TAG_IN_USE`

    The server has noticed that the client sent two
    or more requests with the same tag. This is a
    serious error and always indicates a bug in the
    client.

    The server is not guaranteed to send this error.

 * `UNKNOWN_VERB`

    The verb used in the request is not in the list of
    verbs defined in the server.

 * `READONLY`

    The Doozer connection is read-only. Clients can attempt a
    connection to a new server if writes a needed.

 * `TOO_LATE`

    The rev given in the request is invalid;
    it has been garbage collected.

    The current default of history kept is 360,000 revs.

 * `REV_MISMATCH`

    A write operation has failed because the revision given
    was less than the revision of the file being set.

 * `BAD_PATH`

    The given path contains invalid characters.

 * `MISSING_ARG`

    The request's verb requires certain fields to be set
    and at least one of those fields was not set.

 * `RANGE`

    The `offset` provided is out of range.

 * `NOTDIR`

    The request operates only on a directory, but the
    given path is not a directory (either because it is a
    file or it is missing).

 * `ISDIR`

    The request operates only on a regular file, but the
    given path is a directory.

 * `NOENT`

    Some component of `path` doesn't exist.

 * `OTHER`

    Some other error has occurred. The `err_detail`
    string provides a description.

Error value 0 is reserved.

# Hacking on Doozer

If you want to hack on doozer, we suggest discussing your plans on the
[mailing list][mail] to avoid duplicating effort.
But if not, that's cool too.  Just have fun.

Here are some instructions for building doozer from source:

## Installing Go

I recommend not using apt, homebrew, or any other packaging system to install
Go. It's better to install straight from source.

Abridged version:

    $ GOROOT=$HOME/src/go # adjust this as you wish
    $ hg clone -r release.r57.1 https://go.googlecode.com/hg/ $GOROOT
    $ cd $GOROOT/src
    $ ./all.bash
    (put the value of $GOROOT/bin in your path)

For full details, see <http://golang.org/doc/install.html>.

## Installing Dependencies

If you want to change .proto files, you need two things:

1. Install the `protoc` command (from <http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/>):

        $ sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
        (or)
        $ brew install protobuf

2. Install the Go protobuf compiler plugin (from <http://code.google.com/p/goprotobuf/>):

        $ goinstall goprotobuf.googlecode.com/hg/proto
        $ cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/goprotobuf.googlecode.com/hg/compiler
        $ gomake install

If you want to run doozer's tests, install
<http://bmizerany.github.com/roundup/>.

## Building Doozer

    $ git clone https://github.com/ha/doozerd.git
    $ cd doozerd/src
    $ ./all.sh

This will build the rest of the dependencies and
all doozer packages and commands,
copy the commands into `$GOROOT/bin`,
and run tests.

## Try It Out

    $ doozerd >/dev/null 2>&1 &
    $ open http://localhost:8000/

This will start up one doozer process and show a web view of its contents.
